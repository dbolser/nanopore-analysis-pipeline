    """
    Classify events as ADEPT (short/spike) or CUSUM (long/step) based on duration, SNR, and steady-state behavior.
    
    Parameters:
        data (np.ndarray): 2D numpy array. First column is time (in seconds), second column is signal.
        event_boundaries (list): List of tuples (start_index, end_index) for each event.
                                 'end_index' is exclusive, as in Python slicing.
        noise_std (float): Standard deviation of the baseline noise.
        noise_mean (float): Mean of the baseline noise. (Note: Currently not used in the core
                            classification logic if data is assumed to be baseline-subtracted for SNR calc).
        sample_rate (float): Sampling rate in Hz. Used for accurate duration calculation.
        short_event_duration_ms (float): Threshold in milliseconds. Events with duration <= this value
                                         are primarily considered for ADEPT, otherwise CUSUM.
        snr_threshold (float): Signal-to-noise ratio threshold. Events with SNR < this value favor ADEPT.
        default (str): Default classification ("ADEPT" or "CUSUM") applied initially.
        min_cusum_duration_ms (float): Absolute minimum duration in ms for an event to potentially be
                                       classified as CUSUM. Events shorter than this are always ADEPT.
        steady_state_min_duration_points (int): Minimum number of data points an event must have
                                                to perform steady-state detection.
        steady_state_plateau_slope_factor (float): Factor multiplied by noise_std to determine the
                                                   slope threshold for identifying a plateau region.
        steady_state_plateau_ratio_threshold (float): Minimum fraction of an event's derivative points
                                                      that must be part of a plateau to classify
